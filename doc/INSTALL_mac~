!!! sitll need to check demo before installting spock ( i moved the py to code but just need to check the demo is ok)
This document explains the installation process for SIFT on Mac. There are two main steps:
1- installation of Canopy and python packages
2- installation of SpOCK


Before starting, put the SIFT folder in your home directory (usually /Users/<username>) and uncompress it. Putting SIFT in your home directory is not necessary but if you wish to put it somewhere else, you need to change the paths mentioned in this document accordingly. 

# First step: Canopy
Download and install Canopy and Python packages:
 - go online to https://store.enthought.com/downloads/
 - in Section "STANDARD INSTALLERS", select the macOS 64-bit version corresponding to Python 2.7 (make sure you get the version corresponding to Python 2.7)
 - follow the instructions for the installation
 - once Canopy is installed, open it (if it doesn't open from the Launchpad, open it from the Finder by right clicking on Canopy and selecting "Open").
 - go to the tab "Package Manager"
 - in tab "Available, search for :
  - "basemap" and click on "Install [version]" (the installation might take a minute)
  - "wxPython" and click on "Install [version]" (it might already be installed)
  - "lxml" and click on "Install [version]" (it might already be installed)
 - go to Tools -> Canopy Command Prompt (or Canopy Terminal). This opens a Canopy terminal window
  - in this Canopy terminal window, type: python -m pip install bs4
  - in this Canopy terminal window, type: which python
  - in /Users/<username>/SIFT_v1.3_dev/code/sift.py, replace the first line "#replace this line with the path to Canopy python" with the characters "#!" followed by the path returned by the command "which python" in the previous step. If this command returned several paths, select the one with the word "Canopy" in it. For example, if the path is "/Users/cbv/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/bin/python" then replace the first line of sift.py with the line:
 #!/Users/cbv/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/bin/python
  - save the file /Users/<username>/SIFT_v1.3_dev/code/sift.py
  - in the Terminal: chmod a+x /Users/<username>/SIFT_v1.3_dev/code/sift.py
You're done installing Canopy and the required Python packages.
If you wish, you can run the demo to test SIFT, otherwise you can directly go to the final step (installation of SpOCK). These demos are included to test the functionality of SIFT without invoking SpOCK to generate new SIFT input files. To run SIFT with one of these demo packages, go to /Users/<username>/SIFT_v1.3_dev/code and, from the Terminal, type:
./sift.py demo <demo_file>
where <demo_file> is one of:
 - short: a six hour run of SIFT designed to open quickly
 - long: a longer SIFT run which showcases basic SIFT functionality
 - storm: a SIFT run including several example storm systems
If these demo packages all run successfully then SIFT is set up correctly. The final step is to install SpOCK.


* Second step: SpOCK
see document "SpOCK_INSTALL_mac". In this document (see first line): "spock_dir" should be replaced everywhere by "/Users/<username>/SIFT_v1.3_dev/code/spock" (as explained in the beginning of this document, the folder SIFT should be in /Users/<user_name>).


*** You're done installing SIFT! To launch it, please refer to Section "Normal SIFT Operation of the End User Manual".
