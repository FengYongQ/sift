- make sure the path of spice and gsl in makeall.sh are ./cspice and ./gsl_installation for is_sift -eq 1

- in makeall.sh make sure the compiler is set to mpicc, that all the make clean and make are uncommented
 
- compile code/spock/makeall.sh WITH is_sift=1 and py_only=1. THEN SET BACK py_only=0 and save makeall.sh. This moves the python scripts to code/ so taht users can run the SIFT demo without installing SpOCK. 

- first line of sift.py should be: 
#replace this line with the path to Canopy python", not "#!something

- make sure your password and id for the storm download is not in sift.py (search for "raw_input"). Also check that startdate and enddate with raw_input are uncommented. Also uncomment "if not os.path.isdir(inputFilepath):" to run spock_local only if it has not been run before with the same start and end dates

- make sure .gitignore in code/spock includes cspice and gsl_installation

- make sure .gitignore in ./ includes doc/charles, code/spock/cspice, code/spock/gsl_installation

- make sure you're including demo_input

- add the option -w in the compilation in the Makefile to ignore the warnings (so that when the user compile SpOCK it doesn't print all the warnings). Do so in the Makefile of code/spock and code/spock/src/storm. And in the comilation of find_specular_point: $path_compiler -w -o "$path_spock_abso"/spec ./src/find_specular_points.c -lm # change the path of the executable here

- in code/ (make sure you're in code/): rm -Rf *~ *txt spock/*~ *pyc log_spock* ../input_sift/{cygnss_geometry_2016.txt,my_ground_stations.txt} ../input_sift/201* ../sift.log ../doc/*~ ../doc/~* spock/spock_* spock/*~ spock/.*~ gps-ops.txt* login* ../.*~

for cbv (not for distributing): to update SpOCK and SIFT on git, see the 2 emails on Feb 17 2018 in thread "Research Github". If you push spock from master branch in code/spock, make sure that you had the latest version of SpOCK in code/spock. Otherwise, pushing it will overwrite the previous version of SpOCK on git.
