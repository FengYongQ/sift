The directory where SpOCK is installed is noted <spock_dir>. 

- test if mpirun is already installed on your computer: 
 - in a Terminal command line, type: mpirun
 - if the following message is returned then you need to download and install OpenMpi: "-bash: mpirun: command not found". If you get a message with "OpenMpi could not find anything to do" then you already have mpirun installed so you can skip the next step "download and install OpenMpi"
- download and install OpenMpi:
 - go online to: https://www.open-mpi.org/software/
 - in the first table, select the version "Ã¶penmpi-X.Y.Z.tar.gz"
 - cd to the Downloads directory (usually /Users/<username>/Downloads)
 - tar -zxvf openmpi-"X.Y.Z.tar.gz
 - cd to the folder created by the previous "tar -zxvf openmpi-"X.Y.Z.tar.gz" step (at the time of writing: cd openmpi-3.0.0)
 - follow the installation instructions in the file INSTALL. At the time of writing, these are:
  - ./configure (optional argument --prefix=/where/to/install) (this step takes time)
  - make all install (this step takes time too, really)
 - you're done installing OpenMpi

- cd <spock_dir>
- mkdir gsl_installation

- Download and install GSL C version:
 - go online to http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ 
 - in Section "Downloading GSL", select the link of "your nearest GNU mirror"
 - scroll all the way to the bottom of the page and select "gsl-latest.tar.gz"
 - in Terminal: 
  - cd to the Downloads directory (usually /Users/<username>/Downloads)
  - tar -zxvf gsl-latest.tar.gz (if there is no gsl-latest.tar.gz then try "tar -zxvf gsl-latest.tar")
  - cd to the GSL folder created by this previous "tar -zxvf gsl-latest.tar.gz" step (at the time of writing: gsl-2.4)
 - follow the instructions in the INSTALL document of this folder. At the time of writing, these are, from the Terminal:
  - ./configure --prefix=<spock_dir>/gsl_intallation/ (the --prefix option will install GSL in the gsl_installation folder previously created so that administrator privilleges are not required for the installation. If you don't want to install GSL in this directory, you'll have to modify the makeall.sh accordingly (see further step))
  - make (this step might take several minutes)
  - make install (IF you didn't use the option --prefix two steps before, then you might need administrator privilleges: sudo make install)
You're done installing GSL.

- Download and install SPICE for C:
 - go online to: http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit_C.html
 - select the 64-bit Mac version "Mac/Intel, OSX, Apple C, 64bit"
 - download cspice.tar.Z (you don't need to download the other files. In particular, don't follow the instructions of the README file. At the time of writing, they don't work properly. Instead, follow the following steps.)
 - in the Terminal:
  - cd to the Download directory (usually /cygdrive/c/Users/<username>/Downloads)
  - cp cspice.tar.Z <spock_dir>
  - cd <spock_dir>
  - tar -zxvf cspice.tar.Z
  - cd cspice
  - ./makeall.csh (this might take a few minutes)
You're done installing SPICE.

- Install SpOCK:
 - still in the Terminal:
  - cd <spock_dir> 
  - ./makeall.sh (ignore all the warnings) (IF (and only if) you installed GSL in another directory than gsl_installation (see step "./configure in the installation of GSL") then modify the variable "path_gsl" in makeall.sh) 
  - source ~/.bash_profile 
You're done installing SpOCK.

- Give it a try!
  - cd <spock_dir>/Examples
  - open the file try_spock.txt and modify the line below #SPICE to: <spock_dir>/cspice/data (don't forget to change <spock_dir> with the directory where SpOCK was installed).  For example, if spock_dir is /Users/smith/spock then the line under #SPICE should be /Users/smith/spock/cspice/data. Then save try_spock.txt and go back to the Terminal (you should still be in <spock_dir>/Examples)
  - mpirun -np 2 spock try_spock.txt
If the installation of SpOCK went well, then you shouldn't see any error. 
The message:
"SpOCK is propagating the spacecraft... 100%
- Done propagating the spacecraft."
should be printed on the Terminal.
